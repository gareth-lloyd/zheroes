# Free food options by text message
People most at risk of food poverty may not have access to the internet, even if they have a mobile device.

I have created a service that allows anyone to text HUNGRY along with their postcode to 01290 211 520, and receive information on their three closest food providers.

They can also submit further information about themselves (age, homeless status and gender) to receive more targeted suggestions.

All this is done via SMS, but there is also a public webpage (currently at http://zheroes.ragtag.info/) with all the food information on it, and a simple filtering mechanism.
